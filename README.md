# ElasticSearch Approx Plugin

A plugin for [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) to use approximate
methods for certain queries, to greatly reduce memory usage and network traffic.

Approximate counting is performed via the excellent probabilistic data
structures from [stream-lib](https://github.com/clearspring/stream-lib).

This work is inspired in part by
[elasticsearch-ls-plugins](https://github.com/lovelysystems/elasticsearch-ls-plugins)
by Lovely Systems -- some of their code has been reused here.

## Distinct Date Histogram

Counts the total numbers of terms and _unique_ terms in a given field, for each
interval in a date range.

The API is basically the same as the regular date histogram facet, but with a
few small differences.

* Instead of just a `field`, you must supply a `key_field` (the datetime field
that determines the bucket boundaries) and a `value_field` (the field you are
counting the distinct values of).

* Only string and integer-based numeric fields are currently supported for the
`value_field` (we are working on other types).

* Script fields are not yet supported.

* There is an additional `max_exact_per_shard` parameter (see below).

The output is similar to the date histogram, except each bucket has a `count`
(number of hits) and a `distinct_count` (distinct terms). The facet also returns
a `total_count` and a `total_distinct_count` showing the overall hits and
distinct terms across all buckets.

Example:

    curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/my_index/_search?search_type=count&pretty=true" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "filtered" : {
                "query" : {
                    "match_all" : {}
                },
                    "filter" : {
                        "range": {
                            "datetime": {
                                "gte": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", 
                                "lte":"2013-08-13T00:00:00Z"
                            }
                        }
                    }
            }
        },
            "facets": {
                "histo" : {
                    "distinct_date_histogram" : {
                        "key_field" : "datetime",
                        "value_field": "price",
                        "interval": "day",
                        "pre_zone": "Europe/London",
                        "pre_zone_adjust_large_interval": true
                    }
                }
            }
    }
    '

Returns something like:

                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The facet works initially by keeping a hashset of all terms encountered, but
when this grows too large, it falls back to an approximate counting method.

The `max_exact_per_shard` parameter controls how many distinct values will be
gathered for a given bucket from a single shard, before migrating to the
approximate count instead. This can be used to keep memory usage under control.
It defaults to 1000.

The approximate counting method is hard-coded to HyperLogLog method with a
relative standard deviation of 0.0025, which uses about 80KB of memory per
bucket per shard.

An obvious extension would be to give users the option to control the algorithm
used, and its parameters, so they can tune these based on the expected
cardinality of the field in question, and the desired memory usage. (Pull
requests gratefully received.)

Note that the counts are based on terms, so if the `value_field` is tokenized,
the result won't indicate the number of distinct _values_ in that field, but
rather, the number of distinct tokens (post-analysis).


## Term list facet

This is a simple facet to quickly retrieve an unsorted term list for a field,
if you don't care about counts or ordering etc. It allows you to set a max_per_shard
cutoff similar to the previous facet (defaults to 100).

For example:

    curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/pop1/_search?search_type=count&pretty=true" -d'{
        "query": {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "facets" : {
            "term_list_facet" : {
                "term_list" : {
                    "key_field" : "txt1",
                    "max_per_shard" : 100
                }
            }
        }
    }'

Returns something like:

    {
      "took" : 45,
      "timed_out" : false,
      "_shards" : {
        "total" : 3,
        "successful" : 3,
        "failed" : 0
      },
      "hits" : {
        "total" : 132,
        "max_score" : 1.0,
        "hits" : [ ]
      },
      "facets" : {
        "term_list_facet" : {
          "_type" : "term_list",
          "entries" : [ "trdq", "amrqkke", "ebztmm", "pja", "qobmepbor", "bxpoh", "krsm", "kpgz", "hotodwfq", "qbpxxlfin", "lsnosgx", "qyznyhrqcu", "poekzt", "qbsmks", "adbazy", "swnjdvziqh", "eqabkxb", "xdz", "jlg", "scn", "jdn" ]
        }
      }
    }

There is also a `use_field_data` option (previously `read_from_cache`). If set
to false, this will ignore the ElasticSearch field data, and read the results
directly from the Lucene index. This may be quicker in certain cases, depending
on cardinality, whether the data has already been cached, etc. **However, this
also means that no filters will be applied to the facet data. Any filters
specified in the query which would normally affect facet data will be
ignored.** As a result, `use_field_data` is on by default, a change from
previous versions, as this behaviour is somewhat unusual, and only really for
specialized use cases.

This facet doesn't actually use anything clever like appropximate counting --
it's not really approximate in the same sense as the previous one -- but we
thought you might find it useful.


## Building and testing

It's all done via Maven, so just `mvn test` to build the plugin and run the
tests. Amongst other things, they check that the approximate distinct counts
are within a tolerance of 1% of the expected values.

The tests use quite a lot of memory and take several minutes to run. This is
because they use several iterations of randomly generated data of increasing
size, in order to verify the accuracy of the approximate counts in the date
histogram. The final run puts over a million distinct values in each bucket.

If you get any out-of-memory errors, you'll need to raise the amount of memory
you allocate to the mvn process. From the command line, the pom takes care of
this via the argLine parameter. If you're an Eclipse user, put ` -Xms1G -Xmx1G`
in the VM Arguments box of the Arguments tab in Run Configurations for that
test run.

You can always build the package with `-DskipTests` if this is a problem
(assuming you trust us to have tested before checking in).


### Important note

Because the error rate for HyperLogLog is a distribution rather than a hard
bound, you may in rare circumstances get tests failing due to results being
just outside the 1% tolerance. If this happens, re-run the test. It's only a
problem if it happens consistently...


## Installing

**NB Github no longer supports file downloads. For now, you'll have to build
from source. We will find a location for binary distributions as soon as we can...
Promise :-)**

Type

    mvn package

to rebuild the zipfile (in `target/releases`). You may want to add
`-DskipTests` if you've just run the tests and haven't changed anything,
since they take a while.

Then create a `plugins/approx` directory in your ElasticSearch install dir,
and unzip the zipfile into there.
